# Halmos Dungeon

Welcome to my Halmos Dungeon! This repository contains a series of smart
contract challenges I created while learning Halmos. Follow along as I use
symbolic execution to hunt for the hidden dragon üê≤ (vulnerability) in each
level!

## Level 1: SimpleKnob

I've created this SimpleKnob contract as a simple test case for Halmos.
Initially, the public `property` is set to 1 ether.

The contract includes three functions: `one()`, `two()`, and `three()`.
The functions `two()` and `three()` have checks (`revert`) intended to control
the state transitions, requiring `one()` to be called before `two()`, and both
`one()` and `two()` to be called before `three()` can successfully execute and
modify the `property`.

The goal is for Halmos to analyze this contract and discover the specific sequence
of external calls (`one()`, then `two()`, then `three()`) that successfully
bypasses the revert conditions and leads to a state where the invariant
`property == 1 ether` no longer holds, ultimately setting property to 3 ether.
Halmos should identify this state transition path as a way to alter the contract's
intended initial property value.

```shell
% halmos --contract SimpleKnobTest --early-exit -st

```

## Level 2: HookTakeover

In this challenge, the HookTakeOver contract guards access to its `execute()`
function, which sets the exploited flag to `true`. Initially, only a specific
hook address (provided during deployment) is authorized.

My goal is how to write symbolic test that can find a sequence of interactions
involving `toggle()` and `setHook()` that allows an unauthorized caller to eventually
gain the necessary permissions and call `execute()`, thus breaking the
`exploited == false` invariant.

```shell
% halmos --contract HookTakeover --early-exit -st
```
